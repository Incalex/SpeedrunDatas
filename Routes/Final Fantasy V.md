> Throwing rods and money to those poor enemies is fun

## Before anything ##
**ESCAPE EVERY FIGHT**  
A map can help because sometimes, I have no idea how to explain where you need to go.  
In dungeons, one line is, most of the time, one screen.  
Watch a run and take your notes if you don't like this.  
You should watch a run while reading those notes too, it helps a lot.  
Don't play GBA, some glitches are missing :'(  

These notes were written by [Incalex](http://twitch.tv/Inkalex) and based on Puwexil run.

The path is really simple. Just remember to do Action (X for PS1, A for SNES) at the top of the boat for triggering the cutscene.

Go to the top. A pirate will ask you if you want him to take the ship to the Wind Shrine, accept. Then enter in the Wind Shrine.
