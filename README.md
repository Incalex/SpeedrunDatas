Some random shit useful for speedrunning

## Final Fantasy I : Anniversary
[Notes](https://github.com/Incalex/SpeedrunDatas/blob/master/Routes/Final%20Fantasy%20I%20Anniversary.md) - Markdown design, full notes.  

## Final Fantasy V
[RAW Notes](https://github.com/Incalex/SpeedrunDatas/blob/master/Routes/Final%20Fantasy%20V.txt) - Some parts are in French, but at least it was updated.  

## Borderlands
[Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SyLinQIginFWDG8FeUc6ZFdJ7kRu8FJLW9LKXlgVM5w/edit) - Use JayTOH notes. Thoses are the best and they got updated by pretty much every runner (JayTOH, PeachWaldo and myself).
